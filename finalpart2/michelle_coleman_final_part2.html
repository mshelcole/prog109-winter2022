		What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?
		<br>
		Previously I've had no prior expereince with HTML/CSS/Javascript.
		
		<br>
		Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?
		<p>I usrd a templste to start.  Starting from scratch seemed to daunting, especially from a beginner's pint of view.
		I needed the guidance that the template offered.<p/>
		
		<br>
		
		What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)
		<br>
		
		Deciding on a template was challenging.  Even now I think there is a better one out there that I could have used.
		Also, writing the About Me page.  I didn't know what to present about myself at this point in my life and carreer.
		<br>
		
		
		Has taking this class changed your view on Web Development?
		I'm not sure I had any particular view about it before this course.  I know I really wish I had more of a  
		creative/artistic nature. I now view Web Devlopments as a process for creating digital works of art
		and I have gained a proper appreciate for the process.
		
		
		<br>
		
		What would you recommend to future students taking this class?
		I would say perhaps re-think taking a full class schedule while taking a programmin class.  They take up much 
		of your time because there is so much to learn.  However, if your jist curious about web design or programming in gennerl
		take at least one programing class.  It could lead to a lucrative, rich carreer path.
