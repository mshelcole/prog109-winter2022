		What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?
<br>
Previously I've had no prior experience with HTML/CSS/Javascript.

<br>
Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?
<p>I used a template to start. Starting from scratch seemed to daunting, especially from a beginner's pint of view.
    I needed the guidance that the template offered.
    <p />

    <br>

    What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)
    <br>

    Deciding on a template was challenging. Even now I think there is a better one out there that I could have used.
    Also, writing the About Me page. I didn't know what to present about myself at this point in my life and career.

    Has taking this class changed your view on Web Development?
    I'm not sure I had any view about it before this course. I know I really wish I had more of a
    creative/artistic nature. I now view Web Development as a process for creating digital works of art
    and I have gained a proper appreciate for the process.


    <br>

    What would you recommend to future students taking this class?
    I would say perhaps re-think taking a full class schedule while taking a programming class. They take up much
    of your time because there is so much to learn. However, if your just curious about web design or programming in general
    take at least one programing class. It could lead to a lucrative, rich career path.
