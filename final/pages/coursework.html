          <hr>
          <p>These two courses were truly complementary. I had no prior knowlege of these programming languages. PROG 110 taught me the basics of C# programming, including
              developing coding standards while creating games.

              PROG 109 helped facilitate my understanding of the web and basic format of site pages. It was also easier to understang javascript from concepts I had learned from
              PROG 110</p>
